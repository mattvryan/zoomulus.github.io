Zoomulus is an open source project for cloud computing, created by Matt Ryan.  The goal is to create a collection of software libraries, components, infrastructure configuration, and other things in an attempt to allow those creating cloud-scale applications to spend less time worrying about setup, management, and deployment of their cloud applications, less time worrying about infrastructure and scalability and availability and boilerplate, and more time actually creating the software they set out to create.
